## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a **luxury automotive landing page** from scratch using **React + TypeScript**, with strong visual appeal, responsive layout, and modular styling via **Styled-Components**.

## ✅ Problem Solved / Project Objective

- Design and develop a modern landing page that communicates elegance and performance  
- Implement a **component-based structure** with strict typing for props and state  
- Integrate **modular CSS-in-JS** using Styled-Components for scalable styling  
- Optimize performance with **Vite** and a clean architecture
